## Usage: How to use/play this mod
- Algae: A rare plant found on any sea level water. It may be rare, but when placed by the player it is fast growing,
and can quickly take over even the largest body of water!
- Kernel: A bio-engineered organism that will build structures according to how it has been engineered. Currently created
using 8 algae and a log in the middle. The only structure available is a 3x3 30m tunnel, with log walls and frequent
torches.
